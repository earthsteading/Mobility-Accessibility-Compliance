This interview was part of course work for the Building Surveyor Diploma at Federation University (previously the Ballarat School of Mines) in 2022:

  - RBS: Interview by a Relevant Building Surveyor
  - SR: an Australian who has a sister with a disability

RBS:
Thanks for taking the time to meet with me, SR. Your lifetime of experiences supporting and providing care for your sister and her mobility requirements is a valuable perspective as more buildings are required to become universally accessible. As discussed, we are going to go through the current National Construction Code Requirements for accessibility compliance and your qualitative experience of those requirements from the perspective of being a carer who has helped your sister navigate numerous buildings in her power wheelchair.

SR:
Of course, I’m looking forward to chatting about mine and my sister experiences as a quadrapalegic navigating the built environment.

Q:
This year (Feb 2021) the ABCB released a “Regulatory Impact Statement” (RIS) on the proposed “Gold” and “Silver” specification of the Livable Housing Design Guidelines. The recommendation from the RIS (and the 203 replies to the commission), included the following statements:

* Number of Australians living with a disability: 3 million, with an increase in 2040 to 4.5 million.
* As of 2010, the estimates of new homes being built which meet accessibility requirements: around 5-10%
* The commission called for a universal design in housing which upholds the values of: visitable, adaptable, livable and universal.
* Australian citizens can wait months before a building with accessibility becomes available.
* Rental property owners are not required to allow modification to properties to private renters.
* The cost of living in a home without accessibility compliance is currently estimated at $3-6 billion per year.

RBS:
How have you experienced the above data on a day-to-day basis?

SR:
The most significant issue with the above quantitative data is that it doesn’t tell the human (qualitative) story for what it is like to navigate the built environment which is built by people with their mobility intact. Imaging a world (or universal design) for buildings which caters to anyone with a mobility issue is already underway by numerous projects, designers and architects who are making buildings both accessible and sustainable to live in by everyone! Buildings which embrace both standards and shared values like: being visitable, adaptable, livable and universal. The NCC has always taken a quantitative approach, and it continues to fail because it is primarily controlled by those who may lack direct experience and understanding of the needs of those with disability. 

RBS:
What are some of the qualitative values which you think the NCC should adopt, beyond quantitative measures? Keeping in mind that all the building surveyors across the country need to understand how to adopt these measures?

SR:
The ABCB has heard very clear arguments from the mobility community which include qualitative values which can empower the quantitative measures: let's start talking about the shared values we want to achieve as a society: both quantitatively and qualitatively!

## Qualitative Values of Universal Design (that support the quantatitive measures of AS 1428)

1. Community inclusion and social participation:
 - [ ] Surveyors need to reach out to the community when mobility compliance designs are being checked. This could provide jobs for people in wheelchairs and also provide real user input for the occupancy permit final inspection.
 - [ ] Economically, new jobs catering to their customer needs can improve mental health for people with disabilities.
 - [ ] Accessibility is a more real world risk for all of us , signifiancly more than fire safety and pool safety, e.g. mobilty injuries and deaths due to slips, trips and falls acount for over [40% of deaths and hospitalisations in 2023](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/injury/falls).
 - [ ] This would create jobs in the surveying profession and lead to new design ideas that would make buildings more accessible for everyone.

2. Personal freedom and empowerment and improved mental health:
 - [ ] Universal design can help to improve the personal freedom and empowerment of people with disabilities. For example, by building ramps instead of steps, people with disabilities would be able to get around more easily and have more freedom to participate in activities.
 - [ ] This can also lead to improved mental health, as people with disabilities would feel less isolated and more able to participate in society.
 - [ ] Universal design can help to raise awareness of diversity in society and promote human rights and social impact. By designing buildings that are accessible to everyone, we can create a more inclusive society where everyone feels welcome and valued.
