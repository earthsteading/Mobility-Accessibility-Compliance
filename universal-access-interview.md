This interview was part of course work for the Building Surveyor Diploma at Federation University in 2022:

RBS: Interview by a Relevant Building Surveyor
SR: Sonia, an Austrlaian woman who has a twin sister with a disability

RBS:
Thanks for taking the time to meet with me, Sonia. Your lifetime of experiences supporting and providing care for your twin sister and her mobility requirements is a valuable perspective as more buildings are required to become universally accessible. As discussed, we are going to go through the current National Construction Code Requirements for accessibility compliance and your qualitative experience of those requirements from the perspective of being a carer who has helped your sister navigate numerous buildings in her power wheelchair.

SR:
Of course, I’m looking forward to chatting about mine and my twin sister Cathy’s experience as a quadrapalegic navigating the built environment.

Q:
This year (Feb 2021) the ABCB released a “Regulatory Impact Statement” (RIS) on the proposed “Gold” and “Silver” specification of the Livable Housing Design Guidelines. The recommendation from the RIS (and the 203 replies to the commission), included the following statements:

* Number of Australians living with a disability: 3 million, with an increase in 2040 to 4.5 million.
* As of 2010, the estimates of new homes being built which meet accessibility requirements: around 5-10%
* The commission called for a universal design in housing which upholds the values of: visitable, adaptable, livable and universal.
* Australian citizens can wait months before a building with accessibility becomes available.
* Rental property owners are not required to allow modification to properties to private renters.
* The cost of living in a home without accessibility compliance is currently estimated at $3-6 billion per year.

RBS:
How have you experienced the above data on a day to day basis?

SR:
The most significant issue with the above quantitative data is that it doesn’t tell the human (qualitative) story for what it is like to navigate the built environment which is built by people with their mobility intact. Imaging a world (or universal design) for buildings which caters to anyone with a mobility issue is already underway by projects like ‘Destination Accessible” <https://www.destinationaccessible.com.au/> which is prototyping solutions which not only meet the NCC requirements, but also asks fundamental questions about how buildings can go beyond the measurements. Buildings which embrace both standards and shared values like: being visitable, adaptable, livable and universal. The NCC has always taken a quantitative approach, and it continues to fail because it is primarily controlled by those who may lack direct experience and understanding of the needs of those with disability. 

RBS:
What are some of the qualitative values which you think the NCC should adopt, beyond quantitative measures? Keeping in mind that all the building surveyors across the country need to understand how to adopt these measures?

SR:
The ABCB has heard very clear arguments from the mobility community which include qualitative measures like:

## Qualitative Values of Universal Design

* Community inclusion and social participation:
    * Surveyors need to reach out to the community when mobility compliance designs are being checked. This could provide jobs for people in wheelchairs, which can give meaning to people who find it difficult to find work.
    * This could also help to reduce social isolation and improve mental health for people with disabilities.
* Engagement in the workforce and reduced reliance on social welfare:
    * Accessibility should be recognized as being as important as fire safety and pool safety. This would create jobs in the surveying profession and lead to new design ideas that would make buildings more accessible for everyone.
    * It would also help to reduce reliance on social welfare, as people with disabilities would be able to participate more fully in the workforce.
* Personal freedom and empowerment and improved mental health:
    * Universal design can help to improve the personal freedom and empowerment of people with disabilities. For example, by building ramps instead of steps, people with disabilities would be able to get around more easily and have more freedom to participate in activities.
    * This can also lead to improved mental health, as people with disabilities would feel less isolated and more able to participate in society.
* Awareness of diversity in society and engagement in human rights and social impact:
    * Universal design can help to raise awareness of diversity in society and promote human rights and social impact. By designing buildings that are accessible to everyone, we can create a more inclusive society where everyone feels welcome and valued.
