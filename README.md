# Why should I build my building to be mobility (and accessibility) compliant?
Mobility &amp; accessibility compliance

"_Build buildings for your future self!_"

Accessibility of buildings *must* become universal in all building design in Australia.  Why?  Because over 90% of us will experience a mobility challenge at some time in our lives.  So why not build a building which your future self can use? 

If you are building a property to rent, remember that +18% of Australians (4 million people) have a disability, and many of them wait up to 9 months before a compliant accessible home becomes avaiable for rent.  <-- This is just simple supply and demand for your investment.

# Frequently Asked Questions

What are some easy and cheap ways my building can become more accessible?
  - [ ] The majority of buildings in Australia begin by having a concrete slab poured which the rest of the building is built atop: having your slab poured so that it has inbuilt ramps (instead of steps), is the easiest thing you can have done to assure you (your tennants and your visitors) have the human right to transition easily from indoors to outdoors.

What is Universal Accessible design?
  - [ ] 

I like large bathrooms, but I don't want my bathroom to look like a handicap toilet?
  - [ ] Most people's experience of accessible toilets are in a public space like a mall or store.  These toilets are intentionally spartan and "boxy" so they are easy to clean as they are used on mass by everyone (not just wheelchair users).  In actuallity an accessible bathroom can be a thing of beauty.
  - [ ] The standard for accessibility compliance in Australian is called AS1428.1-2009 "Design for access and mobility" which defines: (a) the proposed location for the WC, hand basin and shower, and (b) the door type and dimension, and (c) circulation.  Other than these simple requirements, it is your choice to design a bathroom which is beautiful and luxurious space you will be able to use based on your mobility needs.  And remember, the no.1 reason for visiting the hospital are slips and trips, so have a think about the value of a bathroom designed for your mobility safety!
